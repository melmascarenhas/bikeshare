### Created February 13, 2022

### Description
This project uses python script to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The core function of the code include: 
1. importing the data; 
2. prompting the user for requests of specific cities data sets and the time periods (months and days of week); 
3. provide descriptive statistics.

### Calculations and Results 
Descriptive statistics that will run for the parameters selected are:
1. Most Common Month when travel occurred
2. Most Common Day when travel occurred
3. Most Common Hour when travel occured
4. Most Common Start Station
5. Most Common End Station
6. Most Common Station Trip Combination
7. Total Travel Time (in Seconds and in Hours)
8. Average Travel Time (in Seconds and in Minutes)

Additional details provided are the users details like gender and birth year depending on the city selected. 

Towards the end of the script, users will have the ability to preview the raw data's first 5 lines and extend the data view if desired. 

### Use Cases
Use case for the data is to highlight trends within the 3 big cities mentioned earlier to understand trends in bikeshare usage. Trends can be used to help increase bike inventory in area of high usage, understand highly visited areas or pick up locations, and help increase usage during time periods that potentially have low usage.
